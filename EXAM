242 FINAL EXAM (75 points)
Answer the following questions. Each answer should be at least 400 words and should draw upon course materials.

1. Explain the differences between (1)coding from scratch with a programming language, 
(2)using frameworks and libraries (such as those for Javascript), and (3)using Animate to develop 
interactives for journalistic/PR/advertising projects. How you compare and contrast them is up to you.
You should develop some key criteria to evaluate the three methods.

2. We began the course by asking the question "Should journalists code?" 
Using arguments from those readings (that means you need to cite them) 
in addition to your experience in the class, weigh in on whether journalists 
should code and if so, what does a "coding journalist" look like? What are their skills?

3. In the first few weeks of the course, you learned about programming terminology. 
Revisit that list of programming terms. If YOU had to teach your newsroom how to program, which three terms 
would you teach first? Why? How would you explain them?
