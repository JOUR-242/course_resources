## POLICIES

### Attendance

This course starts at 12:30 p.m. – be on time for the start of class. Attendance will be taken daily. The instructor’s grade book is the official record. <b>All students are entitled to two excused absences. These absences will be permitted regardless of their reason. More than two class absences results in automatic, one-letter-grade reduction for the course per absence. All absences beyond the first two are considered equally and will be unexcused regardless of their reason.</b>  Three tardies (10 minutes or more late for class) are considered equal to one class absence. Six absences result in failure of the course. If a student is absent, it is his/her responsibility to contact the instructor prior to the absence and be up-to-date for the next class. It is not the responsibility of the instructor to make sure students who have been absent are “caught up,” although students may request handouts that were missed in class. PowerPoint presentations will not be shared with students. Students must take notes. If a student is absent, it is his/her responsibility to get class notes from a classmate.

It should be understood that there is no equating the quantity of one’s work with the quality of one’s work. The amount of information covered in this course is vast; the assignment schedule can be intense. However, superior work, average work, poor work, and unacceptable work remain the same regardless of the number of assignments completed or the amount of time spent. Please make it a habit to integrate in all of your work the concepts you are introduced to. This is a developmental course. Students are responsible for learning AND integrating the information and technical skills presented in this course throughout all of their assignments and projects. Always follow directions for any assignments and projects. Make sure you fully understand any project/assignment procedures. Any coursework submitted that does not conform to prescribed guidelines will not be accepted. Please read the attached copy of Ball State’s Academic Ethics Policy from the University Handbook. 

The University expects its departments and programs that take students away from class meetings to schedule such events in a way that will minimize hindrance of orderly completion of course requirements. Such units must provide a written statement to the students describing the activity and stating as precisely as possible the dates of the required absence. The involved students must deliver this documentation to the instructor, preferably before the absence but in no event later than one week after the absence.

### Due Dates

<b>No late work will be accepted.</b> Assignments will be turned in to the instructor when called for unless directed otherwise by the instructor. DO NOT place assignments on doors, mailboxes, etc., unless otherwise directed by the instructor. Neatness is mandatory and will be a factor in grading all projects. All assigned reports or stories should be typed. The instructor reserves the right to lower a final grade by one letter on the basis of disciplinary problems, demonstrations of rude or poor attitude, or failure to comply with foregoing guidelines. No food or beverages in the computer lab. No makeup exams or quizzes will be given. A student may arrange to take an announced quiz early if the student knows of an upcoming need to be absent, but only if prior notice is given to the instructor, and only if the student has fewer than two recorded absences. The grade of “incomplete” will not be issued in this course. While reworks of assignments may be issued often, there is no form of extra credit in this course unless otherwise specified.

### Academic honesty statement

You will be asked to sign the journalism department’s “Student Academic Ethics Policy.”  If you are found in violation of the department’s “Student Academic Ethics Policy,” you run the risk of receiving a failing grade on an assignment or for a class overall. You also might jeopardize your good standing with the university, which could include expulsion from the university. As of the fall 2007, the Department of Journalism will keep a list of names of students who are caught plagiarizing or fabricating information.

### Behavior statement for P in R’s
When you attend a P in R, please observe the following:
<ul><li>Choose a P in R presentation that is of interest to you. Avoid attending one just because you have to.</li>
<li>Turn off your cell phone and leave your laptop computer at home. Please give your full attention to the guest lecturer(s). Notes should be taken on paper, not a laptop. Tape recorders are welcome.</li>
<li>Arrive at least five minutes before the start of the program. Arriving at start time might be too late, and you might be denied entrance.</li>
<li>Attendance cards are not available once the program begins.</li>
<li>You cannot enter the lecture hall after the program begins. Most P in R’s are Webcast and recorded so late arrivals cause problems with the coverage of these events. </li>
<li>Attendance cards are collected only after the conclusion of the program, which means after the question-and-answer period. Do not plan to leave once questions and answers start. The Q-and-A period is an important part of the presentation.</li>
<li>Please be courteous to lecturer(s), which means no talking to your neighbor.</li>
<li>Do research on P in R’s so you are prepared to ask a good question.</li>
</ul>
Your professional conduct at P-in-Rs will be greatly appreciated. When you attend a 
P-in-R, you are representing yourself, the Department of Journalism and Ball State University.  You are expected to attend one P-in-R for credit in the class. Failure to attend one P-in-R will result in a 5% reduction of your final grade.
